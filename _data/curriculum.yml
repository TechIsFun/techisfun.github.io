        Graduation Thesis: <strong>A platform for audio and haptic rendering of continous interactions.</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        I've implemented a virtual reality application that can simulate audio and haptic textures of different 
        kind of surfaces, with the dual purpose of creating an environment for experimental use and provide a 
        basis for the implementation of more sophisticated applications, i.e. for medical training, remote control or entertainment.
        The simulation runs in real time, with very low latency.
        I've used the Phantom Omni of SensAble Technologies as aptic device; the software component was a 3D graphical interface and a my implementation of an audio synthesis with Pure Data.
        Starting from a model that describes the generation of a fractal noise and other models that describe 
        the contacts between an object and the surface on which it moves, I have realized a parametric 
        implementation of an algorithm that synthesizes the sound produced by a body that scrapes on 
        another. Another algorithm was developed to recreate the textures on haptic virtual objects. The 
        audio, graphic and haptic component runs simultaneously with low latency, so that the audio and 
        haptic rendering are synchronized.
        This application was used to perform a study on the psycho-physical bimodal perception, whose 
        results have confirmed the validity of the models and of their implementations.
