  Get Started with Flutter Mobile Development: All You Need to Know
</h1>



<p><em>Flutter</em> is an open-source mobile UI framework by Google. It was released in May 2017 and the purpose behind creating Flutter was to enable users to create native mobile applications with only one codebase. In summary, it means to use a single programming language to create two different apps, one for iOS and one for Android.</p>

<p>Flutter is a framework that uses the programming language called <em>Dart</em>. The language is a lot older than the framework itself and it was first created by Google in October 2011. It has improved a lot in the past few years and a major reason behind that is the continuous development by Google.</p>

<h2 id="why-learn-flutter">Why Learn Flutter?</h2>

<p>The reason behind learning Flutter is because of the following reasons:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>It is simple to learn. Since it is based on a framework, you don’t have to start everything from scratch. The best part about Flutter is that it is a comprehensive documentation available and a great community around it.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>You can publish to iOS and Android with the same course. No need to develop two different code bases for publishing your app.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Google Code labs offer guided tutorials for getting started with Flutter and launching your first project without any external help.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Flutter can increase user productivity exponentially through performance-focused code and a powerful UI experience made possiblebecause of Flutter widgets.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>The popularity of Flutter can be easily gauged through this diagram.</p>

<p><img src="./images/flutter-interest-over-time.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>As you can see in the past few years many people have started using Flutter because of its ease of use. Google, GROUPON, eBay, and Alibaba Group are also using Flutter to improve the robustness of their apps in a short time.</p>

<h2 id="install-and-configure-flutter-sdk">Install and configure Flutter SDK</h2>

<p>Now that we are familiar with Flutter, it is time to get started with this programming framework.</p>

<p>To get started, download Flutter SDK for your platform (Windows, macOS, Linux or Chrome OS) from this link: https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install. We will be using Mac to go through the whole installation process.</p>

<p>1 - Extract the files to your desired location (for example: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">~/development</code>)</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nv">$ </span><span class="nb">cd</span> ~/development
<span class="nv">$ </span>unzip ~/Downloads/flutter_macos_1.20.2-stable.zip
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>2 - Add Flutter tool to your path.</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nv">$ </span><span class="nb">export </span><span class="nv">PATH</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s2">"</span><span class="nv">$PATH</span><span class="s2">:</span><span class="sb">`</span><span class="nb">pwd</span><span class="sb">`</span><span class="s2">/flutter/bin"</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>3 - Download Flutter pre-development binaries by running the following code:</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nv">$ </span>flutter precache
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>4 - Check if you have missed anything during the installation of Flutter SDK with the following command:</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nv">$ </span>flutter doctor
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This command tells how and what dependencies need to be added to Flutter to make it work without any error. For example, you can find out if there’s a configuration error, like missing command-line tools in Android SDK:</p>

<div class="language-xml highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>[!] Android toolchain - develop for Android devices
    • Android SDK at /usr/local/Caskroom/android-platform-tools/27.0.1
    • Android NDK location not configured (optional; useful for native profiling support)
    • ANDROID_HOME = /usr/local/Caskroom/android-sdk/3859397
    ✗ Android SDK is missing command line tools;
    • Try re-installing or updating your Android SDK,
      visit https://flutter.io/setup/#android-setup for detailed instructions.
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This error means that you won’t be able to build any Flutter project until you fix it. The following output contains some warning that can be ignored:</p>

<div class="language-xml highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Doctor summary (to see all details, run flutter doctor -v):
[✓] Flutter (Channel stable, 1.20.2, on Mac OS X 10.15.5 19F101, locale it)

[✓] Android toolchain - develop for Android devices (Android SDK version 29.0.3)
[✓] Xcode - develop for iOS and macOS (Xcode 11.6)
[✓] Android Studio (version 4.0)
[!] IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate Edition (version 2020.2)
    ✗ Flutter plugin not installed; this adds Flutter specific functionality.
    ✗ Dart plugin not installed; this adds Dart specific functionality.
[!] VS Code (version 1.44.2)
    ✗ Flutter extension not installed; install from
      https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Dart-Code.flutter
[!] Connected device
    ! No devices available

! Doctor found issues in 3 categories.
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>In this case the sdk is correctly configured supposing that we work with Android Studio and not with IntelliJ or Visual Studio code.</p>

<p>The message <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">! No devices available</code> just means that no physical device is actually connected and no emulator is running. We can continue to develop and build our application without any attached device; we’ll need to attach a device (or start emulator) only when we want to launch the app.</p>

<h3 id="assign-the-same-path-to-flutter--dart">Assign the Same Path to Flutter &amp; Dart</h3>

<p>Starting from release 1.19.0, the Flutter SDK already contains the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">dart</code> command alongside the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">flutter</code> command. But if you installed Flutter and Dart at different times, you need to double check paths. Xcode won’t work if the assigned path of Flutter and Dart programming language is different. So you need to assign the same path to both of them. Here is an example of the wrong assigned path.</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nv">$ </span>which flutter dart

/path-to-flutter-sdk/bin/flutter
/usr/local/bin/dart
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>As you can see, files are placed in different <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">bin</code> directories.</p>

<p>Fix your path env variable until you get an output like this:</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nv">$ </span>which flutter dart

/path-to-flutter-sdk/bin/flutter
/path-to-flutter-sdk/bin/dart
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="install-xcode-on-mac">Install Xcode on Mac</h3>

<p>Mac needs to install <a href="https://developer.apple.com/xcode/">Xcode</a> to run the Flutter framework. So, download and install Xcode on your Mac system.</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nv">$ </span><span class="nb">sudo </span>xcode-select <span class="se">\-</span><span class="nt">-switch</span> /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer
<span class="nv">$ </span><span class="nb">sudo </span>xcodebuild <span class="nt">-runFirstLaunch</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Make sure that Xcode license agreement is signed, or else your mobile application won’t reach the build stage. To do so, type:</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nv">$ </span><span class="nb">sudo </span>xcodebuild <span class="nt">-license</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="xcode-emulator">Xcode Emulator</h3>

<p>Xcode offers a mobile application emulator so that you can test the apps that you have created in a virtual environment. Type the following command to run the Xcode emulator.</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nv">$ </span>open <span class="nt">-a</span> Simulator
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Once you successfully run your Xcode simulator, you can start creating your first Flutter app.</p>

<h2 id="creating-your-first-flutter-app">Creating Your First Flutter App</h2>

<p>Type the following command to start creating your app.</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nv">$ </span>flutter create my_flutter_app
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>You will see a directory created. Enter this directory by typing the folder name in the console.</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nv">$ </span><span class="nb">cd </span>my_flutter_app
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Once you have created your first app, you can launch it on the iOS emulator using the following command.</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nv">$ </span>flutter run
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="more-resources-to-learn-flutter">More Resources to Learn Flutter</h2>
